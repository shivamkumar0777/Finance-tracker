# Finance-tracker
Keeps track of incomes, expenses, and savings goals with sorting, searching, and filters. Can save/load from a file and display ASCII charts for monthly spending.
# How it works
You add transactions (like salary or shopping). The program stores them, lets you search or sort (by date/amount), and even shows monthly spending in ASCII charts. Data can be saved to or loaded from a file.
